# startuptweets

**Usage of startuptweets.py**

You should enter the date range and number of tweets that you want to find at most

startuptweets.py year-month-day year-month-day max-tweet <br />
$terminal startuptweets.py 2020-07-09 2020-07-10 10 <br /> 

Beware that as the number of max tweets and gap between the date range increases also the time required for the tweets for required criteria increase<br />
